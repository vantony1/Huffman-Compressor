This is a implementation of a Huffman Compressor.

Huffman's Compression Algorithm takes advantage of the fact that it takes less memory to store a boolean than it does to store an int. The algorithm run through the file and turns 0s and 1s into trues and falses. Then also provides a method to decode a given encoded file.

This project makes use of BinaryIn and BinaryOut files provided by Biswas Tamal.
